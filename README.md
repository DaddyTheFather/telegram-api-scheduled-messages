## Opportunities:
- ✨Ma Adding multiple dialogs to a task.
- ✨Setting the start time for adding scheduled messages.
- ✨The Telethon library is used to interact with the Telegram API.
- ✨Pause during execution. The script will not be executed in seconds if you specify a pause in seconds. Also, you will not expose the Telegram server to a DDoS attack and your account will not be blocked :)
